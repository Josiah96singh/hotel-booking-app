## Purpose ðŸŽ“ Learning React | React Context API | Contentful

My goal was to get a deeper understanding of React and Context API with alternative state management than Redux. Local data was used during development and Contentful to pass data from external means.

## Made with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
- [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)

## Upcoming Features

I would like to add more features such as

- Allow user to Reserve/Book/Cancel a room.
- User Authentication to view those user actions.
- Some more ideas down the road to come.
